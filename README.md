##  Overview

The **Gym Workout Tracker** is a full-featured web application that allows users to take complete control of their fitness journey — from workout tracking to progress visualization.

Developed as part of a **university coursework project**, this app provides an all-in-one fitness dashboard where users can:

-  **Create accounts and securely log in** with password protection.
-  **Track daily workouts** by selecting specific dates on a built-in calendar — all logs are saved in the database and displayed dynamically.
-  **Build a custom workout split**, choose the number of training days per week, and edit each workout to match personal preferences.
-  **Monitor health stats** such as BMI through an interactive health form.
-  **Upload and view gym progress photos** for future reference.
-  **Record personal records (PRs)** for powerlifting exercises — **Squat, Bench Press, and Deadlift** — and compare results on a live **leaderboard** with other users.
-  **Manage account settings**, including password updates and profile modifications.

This app serves as a complete example of how a modern web application can combine fitness tracking, social features, and data visualization into a seamless experience.
