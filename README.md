## 💡 Overview

The **Gym Workout Tracker** is a full-featured web application that allows users to take complete control of their fitness journey — from workout tracking to progress visualization.

Developed as part of a **university coursework project**, this app provides an all-in-one fitness dashboard where users can:

- 🧍‍♂️ **Create accounts and securely log in** with password protection.
- 📅 **Track daily workouts** by selecting specific dates on a built-in calendar — all logs are saved in the database and displayed dynamically.
- 🏋️‍♀️ **Build a custom workout split**, choose the number of training days per week, and edit each workout to match personal preferences.
- ❤️ **Monitor health stats** such as BMI through an interactive health form.
- 📸 **Upload and view gym progress photos** for future reference.
- 🏆 **Record personal records (PRs)** for powerlifting exercises — **Squat, Bench Press, and Deadlift** — and compare results on a live **leaderboard** with other users.
- ⚙️ **Manage account settings**, including password updates and profile modifications.

This app serves as a complete example of how a modern web application can combine fitness tracking, social features, and data visualization into a seamless experience.
